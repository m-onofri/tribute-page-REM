# Tribute Page R.E.M.

In this project I created a single page app dedicated to the famous rock band R.E.M.
This is a project from the freeCodeCamp course and I made it using simply HTML and CSS.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/tribute_page_REM.git
```

Go inside the **tribute_page_REM** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/tribute_page_REM/).


## Main features

* This is a fully responsive single page app.
* The app embed a video from youtube.
* I used horizontal scrolling containers to display the discography for small viewport.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
